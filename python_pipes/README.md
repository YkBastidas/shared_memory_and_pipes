# shared_memory using Python subprocess PIPES
Run B.py with 1 parameter as seed
Example:
Bash
´$ python3 B.py 16´

In this case we only need to run B because we are usinng anonymous PIPES, and anonymous PIPES only can be used in programs that are related, to each other, in this case, we have a parent and his child
